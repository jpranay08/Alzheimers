# Early Diagnosis and Prediction of Alzheimer's

This repository contains the code for an online web platform developed to suggest noninvasive tests for evaluating users' mental status and brain structure, aiming to predict the likelihood of developing Alzheimer's disease in the future.

## Overview

The platform utilizes Python and machine learning techniques to achieve its goals. It has achieved a classification accuracy of 85% with 0% false negative cases, ensuring robustness in identifying potential risks.

## Features

- **Noninvasive Tests:** The platform suggests noninvasive tests for evaluating users' mental status and brain structure.
- **Alzheimer's Prediction:** It predicts the likelihood of developing Alzheimer's disease in the future.
- **Classification Framework:** Implemented a robust Support Vector Machine (SVM)-based classification framework using Python's machine learning libraries, including scikit-learn.
- **Feature Extraction and Selection:** Utilized Python's machine learning libraries for feature extraction and selection to improve the prediction accuracy.

## Usage

To use the platform, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone this repo`
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the application: `python manage.py runserver`
4. Access the platform through your web browser at `http://localhost:8000`
